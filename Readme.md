# Balls is life

STDISCM Problem Set # 1

Authors: Janine Chua Ching, Ayisha Dytoc, Faith Griffin, and Tyrone Sta. Maria

This project is a particle simulator that utilizes concurrent programming alongside C++ and OpenGL.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- OpenGL: A cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Typically included with your operating system or can be updated via your graphics card driver.
- FreeGLUT: The OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a free-software/open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. FreeGLUT allows the creation of interactive programs that use OpenGL.
- Visual Studio: An integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. This project was developed using Visual Studio 2019, but it should be compatible with newer versions. Ensure you have the C++ development tools and the latest Windows SDK installed. Download Visual Studio from [the official Microsoft website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/TyroneStaMaria/stdiscm-balls-project.git
```

or download as a ZIP file and extract it

## Step 2: Checkout Branch

```
git checkout problem-set-2-final
```

## Step 3: Open the Project

Using Visual Studio

1. Navigate to the `Balls/` directory.
2. Double-click on `Balls.sln` to open the project in Visual Studio.

If you prefer not to use the solution file:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Select `File > Open > Project/Solution` and navigate to the `Balls/` directory.
3. Choose `Balls.sln` to load the project.

## Step 4: Build and Run

To build and run the project:

1. In Visual Studio, set the build configuration to "Release" or "Debug" depending on your needs.
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` to build and run the project without debugging.

Alternatively, you can use `F5` to run with debugging enabled if you need to troubleshoot or develop the project further.

## How to Use the program

Here is a demonstration of how to use the particle simulator.
